Objectives for this project:

- Implement Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Test Dijkstra’s algorithm
-  Improve the use of concurrency
- The goal is to make it to the ring in as few steps as possible.
- McDiver’s score is the product of these two quantities:
1. The value of the coins that McDiver picks up during the scram phase.
2. The score multiplier from the seek phase.
